# Welcome to 673/443: Brain-Inspired Computing

The course provides an overview of the fundamental concepts and current trends in neuro-mimetic and neuro-inspired Computing with a focus on designing neuromorphic networks for vision and movement.\
1\. Introduction\
The problem of introducing intelligence in machines is arguably one of the greatest problems in Science. Today's AI neural nets use computational models and algorithms inspired by the knowledge of the brain in the '90s. Powerful as they are, AI technologies such as Watson and Siri, are impressive but their domain specificity and reliance on vast numbers of labeled examples are obvious limitations. This course will extend the current knowledge on learning and inference, and how this can inform the development of new brain-inspired algorithms for intelligent computer vision and robotic control. The goal of this course is to help produce a community of CS students that could translate the current knowledge in Brain Science to intelligent algorithms in Computer Science.

### Course Objectives

1\.     To explore how computation in the human brain can be effectively modeled across different levels of abstraction (from a single neuron to biological neural networks and systems)

2\.     To introduce a computational formalization of brain function based on the model of neuron as a Spike Processing Machine -- Spike Neural Networks (SNNs);

3\.     To employ neuro-mimetic or neuro-inspired SNNs and tackle a CS problem in a term-wide project.

### Learning Outcomes

The students are expected to:

-         3rd week [Pitch talk on the project idea] identify, analyze and present appropriate goals for their project; use the knowledge on the biophysics of the brain computation, which will be gained in classroom and during discussions to conceive and execute their own project (students will be asked to run 2 of their ideas by the instructor/TA/grader before selecting and presenting 1).

-         5th and 8th week [1st and 2nd assignments are due] be able to restate an investigative question in terms of a spiking neural network; successfully relate theoretical concepts on how the neuron computes to a real-world problem in a written report.

-         10th week [Draft Paper is due] demonstrate the ability to find appropriate research literature appropriate to the investigative task; demonstrate broad-based knowledge of the fundamentals acquired through coursework, including general knowledge as well as developing skills during the assignments, spiking neural network design and scientific writing.

-         11th-12th week [Paper Presentations] utilize the most influential scientific literature by identifying appropriate sources, learning how to approach and understand scientific papers; be able to identify the most influential paper for their research project; distinguish the essential from the non-essential information with respect to their project; possess effective oral communication skills.

-         15th week [Final Paper] be capable of working productively with others as part of a team; be able to digest and use the feedback they get when the draft paper returns to them with comments written by the instructor; possess critical thinking skills, problem solving abilities, and familiarity with the computational skills, procedures as well as their limitations, which are essential to the field.

### Academic Integrity

Principles of academic integrity require that every Rutgers University student:

-   properly acknowledge and cite all use of the ideas, results, or words of others
-   properly acknowledge all contributors to a given piece of work
-   make sure that all work submitted as his or her own in a course or other academic activity is produced without the aid of unsanctioned materials or unsanctioned collaboration
-   obtain all data or results by ethical means and report them accurately without suppressing any results inconsistent with his or her interpretation or conclusions
-   treat all other students in an ethical manner, respecting their integrity and right to pursue their educational goals without interference. This requires that a student neither facilitate academic dishonesty by others nor obstruct their academic progress
-   uphold the canons of the ethical or professional code of the profession for which he or she is preparing.

Adherence to these principles is necessary in order to insure that:

-   everyone is given proper credit for his or her ideas, words, results, and other scholarly accomplishments
-   all student work is fairly evaluated and no student has an inappropriate advantage over others
-   the academic and ethical development of all students is fostered
-   the reputation of the University for integrity in its teaching, research, and scholarship is maintained and enhanced.

Failure to uphold these principles of academic integrity threatens both the reputation of the University and the value of the degrees awarded to its students. Every member of the University community therefore bears a responsibility for ensuring that the highest standards of academic integrity are upheld.
