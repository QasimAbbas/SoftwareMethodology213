### UML Diagrams
* UML stands for Unified Modeling Langauge, which is a (mainly) graphical notation used to express object-oriented design
* Three different kinds of UML Diagrams
  * Class Diagram
    * Show classes and relationships between them
  * Sequenece Diagram
    * Show sequences of activities when methods invoked
  * State Diagram
    * Used to represent state-based diagram

### Class Diagram
* A class diagram shows classes and the relationships between them
* The simplest way to draw a class is lieke this: 

| Rectangle |
|-----------|

* Details to the class can be added like this:

| Rectangle |
|-----------|
| width     |
| height    |
| xpos      |
| ypos      |
|-----------|
| resize()  |
| remove()  |

* Attributes appear below the class name, and operations appear below attributes


### Class Diagrams and Attributes Methods
* An even greater level of detail can be added by specifying the type of each attribute, as well as type of each parameter and return type for each method:


### UML Notation for Access Levels

* +:public
* #:protected
* ~:package
* -:private


|  abcpackage |
|-------------|
| + ClassA    |
|-------------|
| - apriv: int|
| # aprot: int|
| + apubl: int|
| ~ apack: int|

| abcpackage |
|------------|
| ~ ClassB   |

### Class Diagrams with Attributes and Methods
* An even greate level of detail can be added by specifying type of each attribute, as well as type of each parameter and return type for each method:

| Rectangle |
|-----------|
| width: int|
|height: int|
|xpos: int  |
|ypos: int  |
|-----------|
|resize(w:int, h:int): void|
|move(x:int, y:int): void|

* Access Level (private, public, etc) for each member

| Rectangle |
|-----------|
|-width: int|
|-height: int|
|-xpos: int  |
|-ypos: int  |
|-----------|
|+resize(w:int, h:int): void|
|+move(x:int, y:int): void|


| Rectangle |
|-----------|
| width: int|
|height: int|
|xpos: int  |
|ypos: int  |
|-----------|
|resize(w:int, h:int): void|
|move(x:int, y:int): void|

### Class Diagram: Relationships
* Relationships between classes are of three kinds
  * Generalization/Specialization (super/sub) 
  * Association
  * Dependency
