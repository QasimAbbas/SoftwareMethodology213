# Software Methodology - Assignment 1 Song Library and Objects
## Lecture #
### 2 February 2017

### Song Library Assignment

* Constraints
  * 3 Functions
* Keep library local in a file
* Do NOT have to make the window resizeable


### Selection Model
* Change Listener
* Functional Interface
  * Interface with a single method
  
  
### Responding to List Item Selection - Dialogues
* Pops up dialogue
  * Alert Dialogue
    * Standard Dialogue
    * 3 or 4 types of dialogues
    * Config depends on types
* Every dialogue has owner
 * Every on display will be relative to owner
  * Header
  * Content
  * Footer
 * Show/ShowAndWait
  * Show
    * Exection of program continues
  * ShowAndWait
    * Blocks execution until dialog is brought down
 * All dialogues are model by default
  * Interfacing with any other aspect of the program
  
 ### Enhancement - Change Item
 * Change model and it effects list view
 * Optional
  * contains an object(reference or null)
 
 ## Objects
 
 ### Object Class
 * Root of java class hierarchy
  * Every class s subclass of java.lang.Object
 * Methods in object
  * Inherited by ANY class
   * -equals: compres 2 objects
   * -toString: returns address of Object
   * -hashCode: returns hashCode value for object
 * Must generally override equals and toString
 
 ### Writing code banking on equals being there
 ```java
 public class Searcher{
  public static <T> boolean sequentialSearcg(T[] list, T target){
   for(int i = 0; i < list.length; i++){
    if(targer.equals(list[i])){  //Don't know what T will be at runtime, guranteed to have an equals method
     return true;
    }
    return false;
    }
  }
} 
 ```
 * Object class defines equals
  * Can use equals and will compile
  * If uses equals in class, overidden equals will be called
  
  
  ### Overriding Equals
  * Boiler-Plate override equals
  
  ```java
  public class Point{
   int x,y;
   ...
   public boolean equals(Object 0){    //Header must be same as in Object class
    if(o == null || !(o instanceof Point)){ //Check if actual object (runtime) is of type Point, or a subclass of Point
     return false;
    }
    Point other = (Point)o; //Must cast to Point type before referring to fields  of Point
    
    return x == other.x && y == other.y; //Last part is to implement equality as appropriate 
   }
   ...
 }
  
  ```
 
 Calling the **Point equals** method
 ```java
 Point p = new Point(3,4);   p.equals(p); // ? True
 Point cp = new ColoredPoint(3,4,"black");  p.equals(cp); // ? True
 String s = "(3.4)" p.equals(s); p.equals(s) // ? False
 Point p2 = new Point(4,5); p.equals(p2); //False
 
 ```
