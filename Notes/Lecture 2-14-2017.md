# Software Methodology - Lambda Expressions
## Lecture 2-14-2017

### Passing Behavior
* Some languages allow you to pass functions as parameters

Setup: Have a method that takes as parameters the list, and a *function*

```java
method(list, function) -> function to be passed
```

### Defining Filter Method to Accept Function
* Start by defining an interface that has only one method
 * This makes it a **functional interface**
* Functional Interface
  * e.g. Comparable(T)
    * single method compareTo
    
```java 
public interface IntPicker{
  boolean pick(int i);
}
```
* Next implement the filter method with an instance of the functional inteface that has a second parameter

```java
public List<Integer>
filter(List<Integer> list, IntPicker picker){
  List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<Intger>();
  for(Integer i: list){
    if(picker.pick(i)){
      result.add(i);
    }
  }
  return result
}
```
* Lambda Expression: Syntax

### Passing function argument: v1
* Named interface implementation
* For each type of filter, make a named class that implements the interface:

```java
public class EvenPicker implements IntPicker{
  public boolean pick(int i){
    return i % 2 == 0;
  }
}
```

```java
public class GreaterThan10Picker implements IntPicker{
  public boolean pick(int i){
    return i > 10;
  }
}
```

```java
List<Integer> list = Array.asList(2,3,16,8,-10,15,5,13);
List<Integer> evens = filter(list, new EvenPicker());
List<Integer> greaterThan10s = filter(list, new GreaterThan10Picker());
```

### Passing function arguments: v2
* Anonymous interface implementation
  * Seen this in EventHandler
* Write anonymous interface on the fly when calling the filter method:

```java
List<Integer> list = Array.asList(2,3,16,8,-10,15,5,13);

List<Integer> evens = filter(list, new IntPicker{
  public boolean pick(int i){
    return i % 2 == 0;
  });
  
List<Integer> greaterThan10s = filter(list, new IntPicker{
  public boolean pick(int i){
    return i > 10;
  });
```
### Passing function argument: v3
* A **lambda** expression is essentially a simplified syntaxx to define the method of a functional interface:
  
  ```java
  IntPicker evenPicker = (int i) -> i % 2 == 0; //Evaluates to a  boolean value
  ```
  
  IntPicker evenPicker = an instance of a class that implements IntPicker
  
  * Interface defines return type
   * No explicit return type
   
 * Since the method *pick* is defined to accept an *int* and return a *boolean*, the LHS of the expression is the *int* input, and the RHS is the *boolean* return
 
  ```java
  IntPicker greaterThan10Picker = (int i) -> i > 10;
  ```
 * Call the filter method
 
  ```java
  List<Integer> list = Array.asList(2,3,16,8,-10,15,5,13);
  List<Integer> evens = filter(list, new EvenPicker());
  List<Integer> greaterThan10s = filter(list, new GreaterThan10Picker());
  ```
  
  * Lambda expression is compiled into instance of object
  * Named lambda expression can be used again everywhere
  
### Passing function argument: v4
* On-the-fly Unnamed Lambda Expression
 
 Call the filter method:
 
 ```java
 List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(2,3,16,8,-10,15,5,13);
 
 List<Integer> evens = filter(list, (int i) -> i % 2 == 0);
 
 List<Integer> greaterThan10s = filter(list, (int i) -> i > 10);
 ```
 
 * Whether type is there is not relevant to lambda that's being used, the matching of types are being done between interface defintion
 
 * Type of LGS var can be dropped since it can be unambigously resolved:
```java
List<Integer> evens = filer(list, i -> i % 2 == 0);

List<Integer> greaterThan10s = filter(list, i -> i > 10);
```

* Generates class with method body
 * No seperate code generation
 
### Lambda Expressions (or just Lambda's)
* A lambda expression gets compiled into an object that implements a **functional interface**, with types resolved according to the context

```java
List<Integer>evens = filer(list, i -> i % 2) -> (IntPicker)
```
* Because filter takes an instane of IntPicker as 2nd parameter the matching lambda expression argument gets compiled to an intance of IntPicker

* Becase the mehtod (name irrelevave) in the **IntPicker** functional interface takes a single **int** parameter and returns a **boolean**, the LHS of the lambda is an **int** type var, and the RHS returns a **boolean**
 
 * Multiple statements in RHS must be in a braces-block:
  
  ```java
  x -> {x++; System.out.println(x);}
  ```
