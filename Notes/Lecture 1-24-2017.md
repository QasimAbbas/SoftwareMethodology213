### Inheritance - Private Fields
```java
public class Point{
  private int x,y;
  ...
}

public class ColoredPoint extends Point{
// x and y inherited HIDDEN
  public int getX(){ //override inherited getX()
    return x;
  }
}
```
* Will NOT compile becasue x is hidden(private)

```java
public class PointApp{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    ColoredPoint cp = new ColoredPoint(4,5,"blue");
    System.out.println(cp.x) //Will NOT compile beacuse x is hidden
    System.out.println(cp.getX()); //4
  }
}
```
* x id hidden
* Inherited getX() method is able to access the x field

### Inheritance - Static Members
* Static variable has been allocated statically so lifetime or "extent" extends across entire run of program

```java
public class Supercl{
  static int x;
  public static void m(){
    System.out.println("in class Supercl");
    
  }
}

public class Subcl extends Supercl{}

public class StaticTest{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Supercl supercl = new Supercl();
    System.out.println(supercl.x);
    supercl.m(); //In subclass
    Subcl subcl = new Subcl();
    System.out.printn(subcl.x); //Inherited from Supercl
    subcl.m(); "in class Supercl" - inherited from Supercl
  }
}
```

* Inherited static fields are statically bound not dynamically

```java
public class Supercl{
  static int x;
  public static void m(){
    System.out.print("in class Supercl");
  }
}

public class Subcl exends Supercl{}

public class StaticTest{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Supercl supercl = new Supercl();
    System.out.print(supercl.x); // ? 0
    supercl.m(); //in class Supercl
    Subcl subcl = new Subcl();
    System.out.println(subcl.x);// 0-inherited from Supercl
    subcl.m();
    
  }
}
```

### Inheritance - Static Fields

```java
public class Supercl{
  static int x;
  public static void m(){
    System.out.print("in class Supercl");
  }
}

public class Subcl exends Supercl{int x = 3;}

public class StaticTest{
  public static void main(String[] args){
  Subcl subcl = new Subcl();
    Supercl supercl = new Supercl();
    System.out.print(supercl.x); // ? 3-Instance field
    supercl.m(); //in class Supercl
    Subcl subcl = new Subcl();
       (static type)      (dynamic type)
     System.out.println(subcl.x);// 0-inherited from static variable x;
    subcl.m();
    
  }
}
```

### Static Method Call binding

```java
public class Sorter{
  public static void sort(String[] names){
    System.out.printn("simple sort")
  }
}

public class IllustratedSorter extends Sorter{
  //override
  public static void sort(String[] names){
    System.out.println("illustrated sort");
  }
}

Sorter p = new IllustratedSorter();
(static type)           (dynamic type)

Sorter p = new IllustratedSorter();
(static type)        (dynamic type)


p.sort();//simple sort
(Sorter Class)

```

* sort() is statically bound to p, meaning since Sorter is the static type of p;
  * sort() is statically bound to p meaning since Sorter is the static type of p, the sort() method in Sorter is called;
  
## Why Static Design Aspects?

### Static for Non Object-Oriented Programmers
* Suppose program that echoes whatever is typed in:

```java
public class Echo{
  public staic void main(String[] args) throws IOExcpetion{
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))
    System.out.prinln("> ");
    String line = br.readLine();
    System.out.println(line);
  }
}

```

* Works without have to create any Echo object.  VM executed main method directly on Echo class becasue main method is declared static.

* Calling the main method on the class make it non-object oriented; object orientations implieas that there is an object or instace which fied access or method executed

### Static Methods for "Functions"

* Extreme use of **static** methods is int java.lang.math
  * Every single method is static
  
```java
public class Math{
  public static float abs(float a){...}
  ...
  public staic int max(int a, int b){...}
  ...
  public static double sqrt(double a){...}
}

```
* Reason is every method implements math func and once returns, nothis is kept around
  * No *state* to be maintained
  
* The Math methods can be called directly from class

```java
double sqroot = Math.sqrt(35)

```

* CANNOT create instance of Math class


### Static Fields for Constants
* Math is utility class with utility methods
* Apart from utility methods, Math stores
  * E
    * Natural Log Base E
 
  * PI
    * Constant of PI
    
      ```
      public class Math{
      ...
      public static final double E ...
      public static final double PI...
      ...
      }
      ```
* Constants can be accessed directly
 
 ```
 double area = Math.PI * radius * radius
 
 ```
 
 ### Static Fields for Sharing Among Instances
 * Consider class with limited instances
 
 * Some ecologicla simulation that populates forest of tigers
  * bound number of tigers
  
 * Need to keep track of current count in TIGER CLASS
 
 * Every time Tiger is created, count has to be checked
  * If okay then incremented
 * Every time Tiger goes out of scope
  * count of Tiger is decremented
  
 ### Tiger - Static Field Count
 
 ```java
 public class Tiger{
  public static final int MAX_COUNT = 10;
  public static final in MAX_MASS = 2000;
  
  private static int count = 0; //Class property shared by instances
  
  public Tiger(int mass) throws Exception{ //Constructor must declare throws
    if(count == MAX_COUNT){
      throw new Exception("Max count exceeded");
    }
    if(mass < 0 || mass > 2000){
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("unacceptable mass"); //RunTime exception, no throws declaration needed
    }
    count++;
  }
 }
 
 
 ```
 
 ### Tiger - Static count field shared by instances
 
 ```java

public class Tiger{
  public static final int MAX_COUNT = 10;
  public static final in MAX_MASS = 2000;
  
  private static int count = 0;
  
  public Tiger(int mass) throw Exception{
    ...
    count++;
  }
  
  public void finalize(throws) Throwable{ //Overrides method inherited from 
    Object class, called by garbage collector when object in scope
    count--;
    
  }
  
  public static int getCount(){ //Client would want to know how many Tiger           instances BEFORE creating(or not){
  
  }
    return count; //Since count is private, needs to be accessed through method that is propery of the class, not instance
  }
}

 ```
 
 
 ### Static: Access
 
 * Statuc fields/methods accessed via class name, of if they mixed in instance fields and methods.  *May* be accessed via an instance of the class
