### Inheritance - Private Fields
```java
public class Point{
  private int x,y;
  ...
}

public class ColoredPoint extends Point{
// x and y inherited HIDDEN
  public int getX(){ //override inherited getX()
    return x;
  }
}
```
* Will NOT compile becasue x is hidden(private)

```java
public class PointApp{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    ColoredPoint cp = new ColoredPoint(4,5,"blue");
    System.out.println(cp.x) //Will NOT compile beacuse x is hidden
    System.out.println(cp.getX()); //4
  }
}
```
* x id hidden
* Inherited getX() method is able to access the x field
