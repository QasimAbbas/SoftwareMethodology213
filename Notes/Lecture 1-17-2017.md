### History of OOP Languages
* Simula 76
* Smalltalk - 80
* C++
* Java
  * Hardware Independent software platform
  * WORA - Write Once Run Everywhere

### Constructor - Initializing

* Constructor initializes objects, does not create
 * In statement **new X()**
  * **new X()** creates X Object
  * **X()** calls no-arg constructor on X to initialize it
* **new** creates objects

* What if we had no constructor?

```java
public class Point{}
```

* Will compile
* How to create a new instance?

```java
new Point();
```
* Compiler throws default constructor

### Constructor - Definition

```java
public class Point{
  int x,y;
  public Point(int x, int y){
    this.x = x; this.y = y;
  }
}
```

* Will this compile?

```java
Point p = new Point();
```
* No matching constructor in Point

### Constructor - Matching Constructor

```java
public class Point{
  int x, y;
  public Point(int x, int y){
    this.x = x; this.y = y;
  }

  //Constructor?
  public Point(int x){
    this(x, 0);
  }

  //Constructor??
  public Point(){
    this(0,0);
  }
}
```

* The other 2 constructors call a matching constructor if the first constructor is not called and sends default values to the first constructor
