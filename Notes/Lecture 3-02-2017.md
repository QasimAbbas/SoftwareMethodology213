### Association and Multiplicity
* As association is a general relationship between two classes, with options for name of association, and number of instances (multiplicity) of participation of each class
* Multiplicticy can be specified as one of the values enumerated such as 1, 3..5

### Aggregation and Composition
* **Aggregation** is a special kind of association that represents a has-a or whole relationship - the whole is the aggregate class instance, and the parts are the component class instances
 * Each instance of ClassA aggregates one or more instance of ClassB
 
* **Composition** is a stronger form of aggregation, in which the components live or die with the containing class (the whole) - a deletion of the whole will lead to the deletion of the parts
