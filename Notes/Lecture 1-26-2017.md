### Static/Non-Static Mix: Another Example

* Parsing a string into an integer e.g. "123" -> 123 //where to provide functionality

OPTIONS:
- Hava a **String** instance method say, parseAsInteger that returns int
  
  ```java
  int i = "123".parseInteger();
  ```
  
  * Bad design: Parsing an int is not inherent/characteristic property of Strinng -not all strings can be parsed as integers
  
- Have a **String** static method, say, parseAsInteger that returns int e.g.
  
  ```java
  int i = String.parseAsInteger("123");
  ```
  
- Have an **Integer** static method, say, parseInt that returns an int e.g.
  
  ```java
  int i - Integer.parseInt("123");
  ```
  
  * Of second and third, which choice is better?
    * Intger.parseInt is better
     * Think of all converting strings to doubles,floats also -- having all these types of converstions in **String** would require **String** to know about formats of other types, which is NOT its business. Best to localize functionality int the class(es) corresponding to the converted type.
