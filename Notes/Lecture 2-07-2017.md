### Inner Classes

```java
public class LinkedList<T>{
  public static class Node<E>{ //inner class  Since nodes are building blocks of lined lists, a Node classs can be defined inside a linked list to emphasize this
    E data;
    Node<e> next;
    public Node(E data, Node<E> next){...}
    Node<T> front;  //Inside LinkedList class, references to the Node type are no different than if node has been defined outside of LinkedList
    int size;
    ...
    public void addFront(T item){
      front = new Node<T>(item, front);
      size++;
    }
    ...
  }
}

```


```java
public class LinkedList<T>{
  public static class Node<E>{ //inner class 
    E data;
    Node<e> next;
    public Node(E data, Node<E> next){...}
    Node<T> front;  //Inside LinkedList class, references to the Node type are no different than if node has been defined outside of LinkedList
    int size;
    ...
}

//in some application code outside of LinkedList class
LinkedList.Node<Integer>(10,null); //Reference to Node needs to be qualified with LinkedLsit prefix

```
