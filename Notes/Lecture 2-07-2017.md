### Method Overloading
* Method Overloading
  * Two methods in a class have the same name but differet numbers, types, and sequences of parameters
    
    ```java
    class Test{
      int m(int x){...}
      int m(float y){...}
    }
    
     class Test{
      int m(int x){...}
      float m(float y){...}
    }
    
     class Test{
      int m(int x){...}
      float m(int y){...}
    }
    ```
* Two or more methods are overloaded if they have the same name but different signatures
  * signature = names + params (return type NOT included)
  
* Method Overriding
  * A method in a subclass has the same signatures as in the superclass

### equals overload/override
```java
public class Point{
  int x,y;
  ...
  public boolean equals(Object o){
    if(o == null || (!(o instanceof Point)){
      return false;
    }
    return x == px. && y == p.y;
  }
}

```

```java
Object o = new Object();
Point p = new Point(3,4);
Object op = new Point(3,4);

p.equals(o); // ? false;
p.equals(p); // ? true;
p.equals(op); // ? true;

op.equals(o); // ? false
op.equals(p); // ? true
op.equals(op); // ? true
```

### Method Overloading/Overriding Static and Dynamic Types
* **Compiler determines the signature of the method that will be called**
  * Look at static type of the object ("target") on which method is called
  
  ```java
  Object o = new Object();
  Point p = new Point(3,4);
  Object op = new Point(3,4);
  
  //Static type of p is Point
  p.equals(o);
  p.equals(p);
  p.equals(op);
  
  //Static type of op is Object
  op.equals(o); // ? false
  op.equals(p); // ? true
  op.equals(op); // ? true
  ```
* Compiler goes to most specific type
 * Since Point is Object, it can go to the Method implemented with Object
  * Although the Point is a Point which would then go to the method implemented with Point
  
* Rules
 * most specfically match the static type of the types of argument
 * At run tiime the actual "target" called object or its superclass chain is searched for determined signature
 
 * If **Point** did NOT override equals(Object) inherited from Object, Object version of equals would have been called which would result in false.
 
 * What if inherited equals(Object) is not overridden and only equals(Point) is coded?
  * call op.equals(p) would result in false even if the point objcets are physically different
  * Inherited equals(Object) must be overwritten
  
  * Sufficient to only override the inherited equals method
  
  * Detrimental to have both, could lead to confusion

### Inner Classes

```java
public class LinkedList<T>{
  public static class Node<E>{ //inner class  Since nodes are building blocks of lined lists, a Node classs can be defined inside a linked list to emphasize this
    E data;
    Node<e> next;
    public Node(E data, Node<E> next){...}
    Node<T> front;  //Inside LinkedList class, references to the Node type are no different than if node has been defined outside of LinkedList
    int size;
    ...
    public void addFront(T item){
      front = new Node<T>(item, front);
      size++;
    }
    ...
  }
}

```


```java
public class LinkedList<T>{
  public static class Node<E>{ //inner class 
    E data;
    Node<e> next;
    public Node(E data, Node<E> next){...}
    Node<T> front;  //Inside LinkedList class, references to the Node type are no different than if node has been defined outside of LinkedList
    int size;
    ...
}

//in some application code outside of LinkedList class
LinkedList.Node<Integer>(10,null); //Reference to Node needs to be qualified with LinkedLsit prefix

```

### Non Static Inner Class

```java
public class LinkedList<T>{
  public class Node<E>{ //inner class 
    E data;
    Node<e> next;
    public Node(E data, Node<E> next){...}
    Node<T> front;  //Inside LinkedList class, references to the Node type are no different than if node has been defined outside of LinkedList
    int size;
    ...
}

//in some application code outside of LinkedList class
LinkedList<Integer>.Node<Integer> temp = new LinkedList().new Node<Integer>(10,null); //Can only create a Node instance of a LinkedList interface
```

## Interfaces

### Comparing for inequality in an algorithm implementation

```
publi class Searcher {
 public static<T> boolean binarySearch(T[] list, T targer){
  ...
  list[index].__?__target //How to compare for inequality? All we know is T is some Object, but Object does not define an equality comparison method
  ...
 }
 ...
}
```
* We need **type definition** for T that will **gurantee the existence of a method** that can be used for inequality comparison

* Solution is to use pre-existing interface that is known to prescribe inequality comparison method.

* Interface includes type that can be checked by compiler for match between caller and callee

* java.lang.Comparable defines **compareTo** method

```java
public static <T extends Comparable<T>>
 list[index].compareTo(target)
```

* Type T is not just any class, but one that implements the java.lang.Comparable interfaec or extends a class that implements interface

### Interfaces
* The term "interface" GENERALLY refers to the means by which object can be manipulated by clients
 * public methods of an object compries implicit interface
 
* Example: Stack
 * push, pop, and isEmpty in Stack define its interface - these methods will be used by clients to create multiple stacks
 
 Interface defined in java.lang
 
 ```java
 public interface Comparable<T>{ //Method compareo, keywords public and abstract are omitted by convention
  int compareTo(T o); //Prescribes a single, compareTo method, but there is no method body, just a semicolor
 }
 
 
 ```
